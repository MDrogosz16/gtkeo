    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p> My name is Molly and I grew up in Addison, Illinois which is 30-40 minutes north of Romeoville. 
        I am majoring in Accounting and minoring in Math. This is my last semester so I am excited for the next chapter. 
        Aside from school, I work part-time as an accountant at a commercial real estate company where I manage 
        five properties. Additionally, I strive to have some time to myself and to spend with my family. My mom grew up in Danbury, IA while my dad grew up in Chicago. 
        They have been married for about 24 years now. I have two siblings, an older sister named Sabrina and a younger brother named Andrew. I also have a nephew named Dominic.
        They (and my parents) get along great with my boyfriend, Michael, of 3 years. My family really has been my support through life and school.

     <h2>My Favorite Hobby</h2>
     <p>My favorite hobby at the moment would be reading. From a young age, I had always loved to read but as I grew older, I found I had less
        time to read. But since the middle of last year, I have been able to find more time and have read quite a few books since then.
        I enjoy reading books in the genres of historical fiction, classical literature, and occasionally, a psychological thriller or a memoir. I'm currently reading a memoir by Brooke Hayward called Haywire.
        A specific book I enjoyed recently was Bram Stoker's Dracula, which was lengthy but enjoyable, nonetheless. 
        I also read What She Left Behind by Ellen Marie Wiseman, Behind Closed Doors by B.A. Paris, and My Grandmother Asked Me to Tell You She's Sorry by Fredrik Backman, to name a few.
